As we get into the colder months of the year, you may think it’s cuffing season. You may even think it is sweater season, or simply “winter,” but those are all wrong.</p><p>No, the season on the horizon right now is party season, baybee! And it runs straight through from Thanksgiving to the new year (though, if we are being real, it starts with Halloween and ends never). And everyone knows parties aren’t about the company or the music or the atmosphere—no siree bob, it’s all about the snacks. And there ain’t no party like a Sporked team party because a Sporked team party has the below items (aka our picks for the best party snacks, in no particular order).</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Not only that, but it is garlicky and delicious and goes with most any savory thing you could think of dipping in it. As for this specific hummus? Well, Sporked staff writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Danny Palumbo</a> thinks this is the best hummus you can buy. The roasted garlic in it gives it a “deep garlicky flavor with none of the pungency of the raw stuff,” and he also said the hummus has an amazing thick texture and “a nice balance of sesame flavor and lemon to boot.” An elite party snack.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dip into the 7 Best Hummus Brands</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketside Spinach & Artichoke Dip</a></h2><p>Is it really a party without spinach and artichoke dip? I would argue that it is not. Whether served hot or cold, spinach-artichoke dip is one of the best dairy-based party snacks, along with onion dip, queso, and ranch. And this specific Spinach and artichoke dip? Ho. Ly. Crap. This one is made with cream cheese, mozzarella, parmesan, and asiago, giving it that smooth decadent mouthfeel and umami punch. Plus, according to Danny, you can see big chunks of artichoke in the dip and they “add some extra earthy tang, and really bring the whole thing together.” If you ask me, this dip is a party in and of itself.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 5 Best Spinach Dips Are Bread Bowl Ready</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion Soup & Dip Mix</a></h2><p>Speaking of dairy products that just make sense at parties, this stuff is pure magic. My mom made this for every single party we had growing up and I can honestly say that it is impossible to get tired of this dip. You just mix a powder packet oniony, salty, umami goodness into sour cream, and then you dip vegetables, chips, or even your face in there, and I promise it will change your life. As Danny said, this dip is “impressively viscous and flavorful. It’s got a creamy, cheese-like consistency to it once you mix in the proper amount of sour cream, and the onion flavor is rich.” Yes to all of that. Another thing he said? “We’re powerless against it.” Truer words have never been spoken.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Dip Mixes: Ranch Mix, French Onion Mix & Beyond</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Casa Sanchez Foods Hot Salsa Roja</a></h2><p>What do you call a party without chips and salsa? You don’t. That’s not a party. And if it is red salsa you are looking for, this flavorful store-bought salsa is one of the best party snacks you can buy. Casa Sanchez’s Roja salsa has got “tomatoes, onions, peppers, and cilantro” which meld together to create “the perfect restaurant-style salsa,” according to Sporked staff writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a>. Chip n’ Dippers, this one is a must-try.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Store Bought Salsa: The 7 Best Salsa Brands to Spice Up Your Life</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Casa Sanchez Medium Roasted Salsa Verde</a></h2><p>Speaking of Casa Sanchez, if you are one of those people whole loves salsa at a party but are also a tomatillo armadillo (people who like tomatillos), then this spicy and complex salsa verde will butter your biscuit (er…salsa your chip?). Jordan said this one has “big pieces of garlic, springs of cilantro, and whole pepper seeds make it seem homemade. The flavor is bright, garlicky, and tart.” Ugh, I am salivating. This sounds utterly fantastic and if a friend had this at their party I might just move in…so I guess serve this at your own risk if you’ve got tomatillo armadillo friends—you may just end up with another roommate.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Salsa Verde to Buy in 2022</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On The Border Café Style Tortilla Chips</a></h2><p>We’ve now given you two salsa choices but it would be weird if we didn’t then give you our pick for the best party tortilla chips. Now personally, I believe tortilla chips are the best kind of chip. Yes, I am aware that Lay’s Classic exists, I stand by what I said. What can I say? I, much like a sweet boy named Tariq,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> love corn</a>, and I will tell you all about it. But let’s get back to these On the Border tortilla chips, which Jordan called “literally the perfect tortilla chips.” They have a “mild corn flavor that makes them feel homemade rather than mass-produced,” and they are also salty enough to be eaten plain, but not so salty they taste like licking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your friend’s lamp</a> to see if it’s real. They also have a slight canola oil taste that makes them seem like they are fresh oot the fryer. Overall, a fire party chip that will have you camped out in the kitchen eating and not socializing for hours.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Best Tortilla Chips for Dipping in Anything</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boulder Canyon Avocado Oil Sea Salt Kettle Style Potato Chips</a></h2><p>They actually had these at the take-out dining halls when I was in college and, let me tell you, these were a fan favorite. The fan was me. I was the fan and they were my favorite. They are crunchy, salty, and avocado oily (yes, you can actually taste the rich and slightly green flavor of the avocado on every chip). And that’s not all—Danny and Mythical Kitchen‘s Trevor Evarts found these to be “crunchy, substantial, and great for dipping,” plus they have ridges so they can grip even more dip. Now I know what you’re thinking: what about these dipped in the aforementioned onion dip?! Good idea. Do it. I’m telling you, you will NOT be disappointed.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 11 Best Plain Potato Chips, Ranked</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kellogg’s Town House Pretzel FlipSides</a></h2><p>Have you ever put a pretzel and a Ritz cracker into your mouth at the same time and then waited for the music to start playing, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ratatouille style</a>? Well, look no further than Flipsides for a bona fide party in your mouth. Er, sort of. It’s basically a cracker that’s a pretzel on one side and a buttery Ritz-esque cracker on the other. On their own, they are pretty darn good. Throw in a dip, sweet or savory, and cowabunga—it’s a textural, flavorful dream. They have a “toasty, oven-baked quality” to them that the Sporked team liked, and were able to hold up in hummus and other dips without breaking. In other words, these are the best of both worlds, in more ways than one.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Saltiest, Tastiest, Best Crackers</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ore-Ida Gourmet Onion Rings</a></h2><p>Ore-Ida may have invented tater tots, but they are not a one-trick po(ny)tato. Believe me when I say that Ore-Ida is an expert in all things fried in the frozen aisle. These deliver on the promise of restaurant/bar quality onion rings from the comfort of your own home. Sporked managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> pointed out that with “nice, thick slices of real onion, these things are like big, greasy bangle bracelets with a breading that packs a lot of crunch.” Which, mind you, is what onion rings should be. These are so good that I might just have to throw an onion-themed soiree this party season just so I can justify buying these and sharing them with friends (and justify buying a Shrek onesie and baking my family recipe for onion cookies—a real thing that exists).</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Set Aside the Fries and Try These 5 Frozen Onion Rings</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TGI Fridays Mozzarella Sticks</a></h2><p>Lastly, mozzarella sticks. These are more for get-togethers&nbsp;with a few friends than the big pulsating music, dancing till sunrise, forgot-my-jacket-somewhere-and-will-probably-never-see-it-again kind of parties. That being said, the best kinds of parties are the ones where mozz sticks match the energy and, quite honestly, these particular TGI Friday’s Mozzarella sticks could match the energy at any party—even a rager. Because, seriously, who doesn’t love a good mozzarella stick? Not to mention that these have “good flavor, great quality cheese, and a crispy, crunchy panko breading.” In addition, Danny confirmed that the “mozzarella blend […] melts perfectly while still maintaining a nice, creamy flavor.” A mozzarella stick with an ooey-gooey, stretchy center can even make a non-party into a party, so serve them at an actual party and who knows what might happen…the greatest party on earth, perhaps?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Frozen Mozzarella Sticks to Buy in 2022</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuvMCrq7Jlo6OupLfSaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-party-snacks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-party-snacks.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-party-snacks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-party-snacks.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-party-snacks.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-party-snacks.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-johnny-depp-and-winona-ryder.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-johnny-depp-and-winona-ryder.html>What happened to Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pool-party-jello-shots.html>Pool Party Jello Shots - Mom On Timeout</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pool-party-jello-shots.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
