Victor Peter Chang, AC, is an Australian cardiac surgeon who performed the first contemporary heart transplant in Australia.</strong></p><p>China is where he was born. One of the most notorious murders in Australian history, it rocked the country when it happened in 1991.</p><p>Before taking home the 1999 People’s Choice Award for Australian of the Century, Chang was given a state burial.</p><p>He worked at St. Vincent’s Hospital after he graduated from the University of Sydney’s medical program. After that, he received surgical training in the US and the UK before going back to Australia.</p><p>He established the National Cardiac Transplant Unit at St. Vincent’s Hospital, the leading lung and heart transplant center in the country.</p><p>Chang oversaw the development of the artificial heart valve and achieved a high success rate in heart transplant procedures.</p><p>We have gathered some material and developed this post in response to the widespread searches on the internet for news and updates on the murder of Dr. Victor Chang.</p><h2>Recalling the Death of Dr. Victor Chang: An Update on Murder Case</h2><p>Everyone was startled by Dr. Victor Chang’s death since it was a horrible murder. During an attempted extortion, Chang was shot twice in the head in the early hours of July 4, 1991.</p><p>His corpse was found sprawled in the gutter beside his Mercedes-Benz 500SL in the Mosman neighborhood of Sydney.</p><p>Chang was selected at random by Chew Seng (Ah Sung) Liew and Choon Tee (Phillip) Lim, two Malaysian men, from a magazine featuring Asians who had “made it good” in Australia.</p><p>After they collided Chang’s Toyota Corolla with their own, they made him stop. After a disagreement with Chang, who refused to give them money, Liew fired the last shots.</p><p>The first shot passed through the right ear and out of the right cheek, while the deadly second shot was fired at point-blank range, penetrating the right temple and passing into the brain.</p><p>Police investigators first suspected Triad syndicates were involved, but ultimately came to the conclusion that the killing was a clumsy performance.</p><h2>Victor Chang’s Trial and Memorial</h2><p>Liew pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 26 years in prison with a 20-year non-parole term after New South Wales abolished the death penalty in 1985.</p><p>Lim received a sentence ranging from 18 to 24 years as a minimum to maximum. Lim entered a not-guilty plea and said that he had no idea Liew had a pistol.</p><p>Another person, Stanley Ng, gave up on an extortion attempt the day before the murder. Twice he had tried, but failed, to put Chang in jail in exchange for a $3 million donation from him.</p><p>Ng’s testimony was compensated with immunity.</p><p>In order to coerce Chang into making a bank withdrawal, the prosecution claims that the plan was to abduct Chang, tie him and his family up in their Clontarf home, and threaten to hang them.</p><p>Liew was granted release after serving 21 years in prison. During his parole hearing, he expressed his sincere regret for the act and said that his long jail term had been helpful.</p><p>NSW Attorney General Greg Smith briefly objected, but he subsequently withdrew it.</p><p>When Liew was released from jail on October 12, 2012, immigration officers met him. He was sent back to Malaysia the next day.</p><p>Chang was given a state funeral. Chang was cremated, and his bones were buried behind a memorial plaque in Green Park, Darlinghurst, across from St. Vincent’s Hospital.</p><p>According to the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute website, this is a “tragic circumstance.”</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
