Later, Beckett will team up briefly with two activists, Eleni (Maria Votti) and Lena (Vicky Krieps), who are headed into town to attend that rally.</description></item><item><title>Corbin Bleu Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</title><link>/corbin-bleu-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-164454-html.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/corbin-bleu-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-164454-html.html</guid><description>Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman have rejoined for Lifetime’s Christmas film ‘A Christmas Dance Reunion,’ fifteen years after they initially showed up on the High School Musical show.
