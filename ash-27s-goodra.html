It often played with a <a href=# title="Wooper (anime)">Wooper</a>, which it was close friends with. One day, while it was playing with Wooper, a large swarm of <a href=# title="Ariados (Pokémon)">Ariados</a>, <a href=# title="Yanmega (Pokémon)">Yanmega</a>, <a href=# title="Pinsir (Pokémon)">Pinsir</a>, <a href=# title="Beedrill (Pokémon)">Beedrill</a>, and <a href=# title="Seviper (Pokémon)">Seviper</a> began to invade the homeland under the command of a <a href=# title="Florges (anime)">Florges</a>. Goomy, being exceptionally weak and fearful, ran around and panicked, and could do nothing to defend itself or the fellow inhabitants from the intruders except cry. It and Wooper were then confronted by Florges and it was struck by a Moonblast, which sent Goomy flying and caused it to land on a fleeing <a href=# title="Swanna (Pokémon)">Swanna</a>. Due to this frightening and unusual experience, Goomy developed an immense fear of <a href=# title="Bug (type)">Bug</a>- and <a href=# title="Fairy (type)">Fairy-type</a> Pokémon.</p><p>Goodra first appeared as Goomy in <i><a href=# title=XY055>A Slippery Encounter!</a></i>, where it dropped from the same Swanna onto <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a>'s head. It looked weak and tired, so Ash and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a> took it to a nearby river to heal the Soft Tissue Pokémon. After having water poured on it, Goomy quickly recovered its health. When <a href=# title="Clemont's Dedenne">Dedenne</a> popped out of <a href=# title="Bonnie (anime)">Bonnie</a>'s bag to greet it, Goomy hid behind Ash, as it is weak to Fairy-types. After traveling for a while, Goomy was frightened once more by a disturbed <a href=# title="Ariados (Pokémon)">Ariados</a> whose tree had been attacked by <a href=# title="Clemont's Chespin">Chespin</a>. Confused, <a href=# title="Clemont (anime)">Clemont</a> decided to use one of his inventions to see why Goomy was terrified of Bug-type Pokémon; this revealed Goomy's backstory.</p><p>When Goomy and <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> were captured by <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>, Goomy watched as Pikachu tried to escape. The cage absorbed Pikachu's <a href=# title="Thunderbolt (move)">Thunderbolt</a>, so Pikachu rammed into the side of the cage until he made a hole big enough for them to squeeze out of. Goomy could slip through, but it was too tight for Pikachu. Seeing Pikachu's predicament, Goomy slipped back into the cage and used its slimy body to help Pikachu squeeze through.</p><p>While escaping Team Rocket, Goomy managed to slow <a href=# title=James>James</a> down with <a href=# title="Rain Dance (move)">Rain Dance</a>, giving Ash and his friends enough time to battle the trio. However, when <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Fletchinder">Fletchinder</a> and Pikachu tried to fend off Team Rocket, they ended up getting <a href=# title="Confusion (status condition)">confused</a> by <a href=# title="James's Inkay">Inkay</a>'s <a href=# title="Psybeam (move)">Psybeam</a>, making them attack each other. As Ash grabbed onto both of his Pokémon to try and calm them, Goomy began to admire the lengths Ash would go to to protect his Pokémon, motivating it to fight. After intercepting <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Jessie's Pumpkaboo">Pumpkaboo</a> and Inkay's combined <a href=# title="Dark Pulse (move)">Dark Pulse</a> and Psybeam, it used Bide to absorb the hits and eventually defeat Team Rocket. Later, Goomy indicated to Pikachu that it wanted to go with Ash, allowing Ash to capture it in a <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a>.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=With_Ash>With Ash</span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY056>One for the Goomy!</a></i>, Goomy was sent out to meet the rest of the Pokémon. The group initially intimidated it, especially Dedenne; however, it warmed up to them as they played. When they were interrupted by Team Rocket's attempt to capture everyone's Pokémon, Goomy, Dedenne, <a href=# title="Serena's Pancham">Pancham</a>, <a href=# title="Serena (anime)">Serena</a>, and Bonnie were separated from the group. While Serena was battling Team Rocket, Goomy remembered what happened to its old home and fled. Team Rocket found Goomy and attempted to capture it, but Dedenne stopped them. Once Goomy saw how much Dedenne cared for it, it battled against Team Rocket long enough for Ash and the others to find them. After the battle, Goomy started affectionately nibbling on Dedenne's ear, no longer afraid of him.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e4/XY061.png/375px-XY061.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Goomy being protected by Ash<p>In <i><a href=# title=XY058>The Green, Green Grass Types of Home!</a></i>, Ash had Goomy watch his <a href=# title="Coumarine Gym">Coumarine Gym</a> battle against <a href=# title=Ramos>Ramos</a> to help it get stronger. <a href=# title=XY061>Later on</a>, Goomy had a practice battle against Pikachu but was interrupted by an injured <a href=# title="Spoink (Pokémon)">Spoink</a>. After Spoink recovered, they followed it to its home, where they found a <a href=# title="Grumpig (Pokémon)">Grumpig</a> bullying all of the Spoink. Ash and the others tried to stop Grumpig, but it hypnotized the Spoink into attacking them and forced them into Team Rocket's trap. Goomy and Dedenne later sneaked out of the cage and attempted to get the key but got caught by Grumpig. Dedenne battled Grumpig and lost, which encouraged Goomy to fight. Goomy used Bide to counter all of Grumpig's attacks, but couldn't do much without any offensive moves. When Goomy was about to be hit by <a href=# title="Iron Tail (move)">Iron Tail</a>, Ash jumped in the way and defended it from harm. Seeing how much Ash cared for it allowed Goomy to evolve into Sliggoo and learn Dragon Breath, and was easily able to defeat Grumpig and Team Rocket.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY065>Good Friends, Great Training!</a></i>, Ash showed Sliggoo to his <a href=# title=Rival>rival</a> <a href=# title="Tierno (anime)">Tierno</a>. They agreed to have a <a href=# title="Double Battle">Double Battle</a>, with Ash using Sliggoo and Pikachu against <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Tierno's Wartortle">Tierno's Wartortle</a> and <a href=# title="Raichu (Pokémon)">Raichu</a>. Before the battle could begin, Team Rocket appeared with their <a href=# title="Team Rocket's mechas">mecha</a> and tried to capture Pikachu. Sliggoo was able to rescue Pikachu by using Dragon Breath on the machine, but Team Rocket managed to grab it, Wartortle, and Raichu. After Raichu attacked James and Wartortle attacked Jessie, Jessie used Pumpkaboo to attack the cage in retaliation with <a href=# title="Shadow Ball (move)">Shadow Ball</a>, which caused it to fall down a cliff and shatter at the bottom, freeing the Pokémon.</p><p>When they encountered a rock in the way, Sliggoo tried to destroy it by ramming into it. Though it initially failed, together with Wartortle and Raichu, it was able to destroy the rock. Just before Pikachu was about to be captured by Team Rocket's mecha, Sliggoo rammed into it, destroying it and rescuing Pikachu. A Shadow Ball launched by <a href=# title=Jessie>Jessie</a>'s Pumpkaboo then accidentally hit the remains of the mecha. This started a fire, which surrounded Ash, Serena, and Pikachu. Sliggoo remembered how, when it was a Goomy, a group of Pokémon was trapped in a similar situation. Bolstered by the memory, Sliggoo used Rain Dance to protect its <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainer</a>, put out the fire, and evolved into Goodra in the process. It then used its new move, Dragon Pulse, to blast Team Rocket off. Later on, it and Pikachu resumed the Double Battle against Tierno's Wartortle and Raichu. As Pikachu struggled against Wartortle, Goodra used Bide to counter Raichu's <a href=# title="Charge Beam (move)">Charge Beam</a> and <a href=# title="Focus Blast (move)">Focus Blast</a> and hit Wartortle and Raichu after Pikachu used Iron Tail to block a countering <a href=# title="Hydro Pump (move)">Hydro Pump</a>. After Goodra and Pikachu blocked another attack by Wartortle and Raichu, they defeated them with a Thunderbolt and Dragon Pulse, winning Ash the battle.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e1/Ash_Goodra_vs_Clemont_Luxray.png/375px-Ash_Goodra_vs_Clemont_Luxray.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Goodra battling Luxray<p>In <i><a href=# title=XY067>The Moment of Lumiose Truth!</a></i>, Ash used Goodra as his second Pokémon in his <a href=# title="Lumiose Gym">Lumiose Gym</a> battle against Clemont, first sending it out to face <a href=# title="Clemont's Heliolisk">Heliolisk</a>. Eventually, Heliolisk used <a href=# title="Thunder Wave (move)">Thunder Wave</a> to <a href=# title="Paralysis (status condition)">paralyze</a> Goodra, forcing Ash to recall him. He later sent out Goodra as his last Pokémon, which went up against Clemont's last Pokémon, <a href=# title="Clemont's Luxray">Luxray</a>. At first, Goodra was at a disadvantage since it was still paralyzed, and Luxray had <a href=# title="Electric Terrain (move)">Electric Terrain</a> active, making all of its <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric-type</a> moves more powerful. However, upon remembering how Goomy had regained its energy when water was poured onto him, Ash had Goodra use Rain Dance, which both nullified Electric Terrain and activated Goodra's <a href=# title="Hydration (Ability)">Hydration</a> <a href=# title=Ability>Ability</a>, curing it from its paralysis. Midway into the battle, Ash told Goodra to use Bide, forcing it to endure Luxray's attacks. Clemont intended to defeat Goodra before Bide was finished charging. Still, Luxray's attacks were incapable of dealing enough damage, and Goodra released the gathered energy at Luxray, defeating it and winning the Gym battle for Ash, thus earning him the <a href=# title=Badge>Voltage Badge</a>.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/43/Ash_Goodra_Hydration.png/375px-Ash_Goodra_Hydration.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Hydration activated<p>In <i><a href=# title=XY069>Defending the Homeland!</a></i>, Ash and his friends came across <a href=# title=Keanan>Keanan</a>, the caretaker of Goodra's homeland. Goodra became hesitant to return to its home, remembering how it was forced out. However, Wooper and many other residents encountered Goodra instead, allowing them to reunite. When the Pokémon noted that Florges and her army were attacking more Pokémon, Goodra intervened, motivating the other Pokémon to fight back and draw Florges out. During the battle with Florges, Goodra was forced to defend its fellow Pokémon, using its body to shield them from her attacks, heavily damaging it. As Florges was about to finish Goodra off with a <a href=# title="Moonblast (move)">Moonblast</a>, Goodra managed to stand up at Ash's encouragement, learning <a href=# title="Ice Beam (move)">Ice Beam</a> in the process. Goodra's Ice Beam managed to overpower Florges's Moonblast, defeating her. Just then, Goodra was knocked out by a <a href=# title="Shadow Ball (move)">Shadow Ball</a> and <a href=# title="Psybeam (move)">Psybeam</a> surreptitiously fired by Jessie's Pumpkaboo and James's Inkay, forcing both sides to retreat and recuperate. While Goodra slept, Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper were abducted by an <a href=# title="Ariados (Pokémon)">Ariados</a> under the orders of Florges, who had been blackmailed by Team Rocket.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY070>Beyond the Rainbow!</a></i>, the group pursued Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper despite Goodra's injuries. Eventually, only Ash, Bonnie, and Goodra reached Florges's hideout, where they found Florges holding a weak <a href=# title="Floette (Pokémon)">Floette</a>. At that moment, Team Rocket betrayed Florges, draining the mystical water inside the cave and revealing Florges's true motives for saving Floette. After escaping, Goodra changed its opinion of Florges and joined forces with her to rescue Pikachu, Dedenne, and Wooper and send Team Rocket blasting off. Goodra then used Rain Dance, restoring the mystical water and saving Floette. With Floette nursed back to health, Florges and Goodra made a truce and Florges was forgiven for all of the trouble she caused. Ash then decided that Goodra should stay behind in its homeland when he saw Goodra happy with its friends. They had a tearful goodbye and promised to meet again someday.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY112>Master Class Is in Session!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=XY113>Performing a Pathway to the Future!</a></i>, Goodra watched Serena's Master Class <a href=# title="Pokémon Showcase">Pokémon Showcase</a> from <a href=# title="Gloire City">Gloire City</a> alongside Keanan and the other swamp Pokémon.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY123>A Diamond in the Rough!</a></i>, Goodra met up with Ash and his friends again when they visited the wetlands on their way to <a href=# title="Lumiose City">Lumiose City</a>. In the process, Goodra also befriended <a href=# title="Ash's Noivern">Ash's Noivern</a> and <a href=# title=Squishy>Squishy</a>. Goodra later helped a group of <a href=# title="Carbink (Pokémon)">Carbink</a> search for one of their friends, who was somewhere in the wetlands playing pranks on the other wetland Pokémon. When the Carbink was finally found, Team Rocket appeared in a mecha with the other Carbink trapped in it. Goodra, however, had its friends use <a href=# title="Water Gun (move)">Water Gun</a> to blast the Carbink through the arms of the mecha, freeing the others. Afterward, Goodra managed to destroy the mecha and blast Team Rocket off. Then, Goodra, the other Pokémon, Ash and his friends relaxed and played in the wetlands' spring, during which Ash promised it he would win the <a href=# title="Kalos League">Kalos League</a>. It was <a href=# title=XY126>later</a> revealed that Ash had asked Goodra to return for the <a href=# title="Lumiose Conference">Lumiose Conference</a>, which it had agreed to do.

After a hard-fought battle, Goodra used Bide, which Slurpuff countered with Fairy Wind. The explosion caused by the collision of their attacks knocked both Pokémon out.

Though Goodra was hit in succession by Bisharp's Iron Head and Focus Blast attacks, it withstood them and hit Bisharp with a powerful Bide. Despite this, Bisharp was still able to battle and score another hit with Iron Head. As Goodra fell to its knees, Ash had it use one last Dragon Pulse, but Bisharp used <a href=# title="Guillotine (move)">Guillotine</a> to cut through the attack and defeat the Dragon Pokémon.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY132>A Towering Takeover!</a></i>, Goodra, along with Ash and Ash's other Pokémon, was taken captive at the top of Prism Tower by <a href=# title=Lysandre>Lysandre</a>.

In <i><a href=# title=XY065>Good Friends, Great Training!</a></i>, an explosion from one of <a href=# title="Team Rocket's mechas">Team Rocket's mechas</a> caused a fire that reminded it of a group of stranded, young Pokémon surrounded by the fires of the invasion. However, the memory lead Sliggoo to take action, using Rain Dance to put out the flames and trigger its evolution.</p><p>After evolving, Goodra's power and endurance became substantially higher, as it was not only able to deal large amounts of damage but take hits as well without being knocked out. This endurance was usually followed up with a Bide attack against the opponents to deal massive damage. Goodra grew into a brave, strong, and kind Pokémon under Ash's care; in <i><a href=# title=XY069>Defending the Homeland!</a></i>, Goodra completely overcame its fear of Bug-types, Fairy-types, and Poison-types to defend its homeland against <a href=# title="Florges (anime)">Florges's</a> Bug-type army. Although it still faltered for a moment after seeing the Blue Flower Florges, it successfully defended itself with encouragement from Ash and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a>. Even after a long absence, Goodra's endurance was shown to be as strong as ever, seen when it took consecutive hits from Dazzling Gleam, Fairy Wind, and Flamethrower in the Full Battle against Sawyer's Slurpuff without being knocked out.</p><p>It was also shown in <i><a href=# title=XY067>The Moment of Lumiose Truth!</a></i> that it blushes when it wins a battle and Ash thanks it for the hard work. However, it means that Ash's promise was fulfilled as in <i><a href=# title=XY055>A Slippery Encounter!</a></i>, Ash promised to help Goodra get stronger, and he succeeded.</p><h2><span
