He replaced Bill O’Reilly after the latter was charged with sexual misconduct. Now The Sean Hannity Show has a global appeal making him a household name worldwide. Not only that, but Hannity has been in the headlines for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitting under oath</a> that he knew former President Donald Trump’s claims of 2020 election voter fraud were misleading.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>While we are well-acquainted with his ideological affiliations and political stance, it’s his dating life that has been hitting the headlines for two years since announcing his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce from ex-wife Jill Rhodes</a>. Adding intrigue to the story, the rumor is that the 61-year-old Hannity is dating his fellow Fox News host, 46-year-old <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ainsley Earhardt</a></strong>. The pair have yet to reveal their relationship, but they have been publicly spotted a couple of times, which implies that they are more than just friends.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-ainsley-earhardt data-injectable=false>Who is Ainsley Earhardt?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ainsley Earhardt (@aearhardt)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>Earhardt, not unlike her alleged romantic partner, is also a popular figure for the right-leaning news station. She graduated from the University of South Carolina with a major in journalism. In 2007, she joined Fox News and became a co-host at Fox & Friends. Two years prior to that, she worked at KENS-TV in San Antonio, Texas. She also was featured on Fox & Friends Weekends, Fox’s All-American New Year’s Eve, and America’s News Headquarters, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">where she served as a co-host</a>.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>The co-host of Fox & Friends has been married twice. She wed Kevin McKinney in 2005, but the couple got divorced in 2009. In 2019, she divorced Will Proctor after seven years of marriage. They have a daughter named Hayden. While the possibility of Hannity and Earhardt is not entirely shocking, neither party has officially confirmed their relationship. Here’s what we can gather.</p><h2 id=h-are-they-dating data-injectable=false><strong>Are they dating?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ainsley-Earhardt.png><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, two of Hannity’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">closest friends confirmed they are dating</a>. Another source claimed that the two have been dating since 2019, the year of their respective divorces. They also appeared to be together at a public event in 2020, which just adds fuel to the gossip.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>The sources said that in various social situations, both of them acted as if they were a couple. “I knew they were involved. I saw it when we were all together,” said one of the Fox staff members. The suspicions about their dating strengthened when it was reported that Earhardt shot the pandemic remote episodes of Fox & Friends from Hannity’s basement.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>When rumors about their relationship started to take shape, Earhardt said in 2020 that she wasn’t dating Hannity. Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, she said, “Right now I am focused on raising my daughter and I am not dating anyone. As anyone at Fox News will tell you, Sean is a wonderful person, and whomever he chooses to date will be extremely fortunate.”</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>When the same question was asked to Hannity, his answer was, “I do not discuss my personal life in public.” In response, one of the Fox News staff claimed, “He’s very private because he’s very famous, and he’s very controversial, but it’s been an open secret that they have been seeing each other,” somehow implying that the ongoing rumors may well be true.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>In April 2023, even more potential confirmation of their relationship was revealed. A source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> that “they are extremely happy together and have been for a while. It’s not a surprise to anyone who knows them, but they’re very private people and prefer to keep their personal life private and lowkey”.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=false>The report also revealed that the duo was seen vacationing in Florida together and that Hannity was building another room in his home as his relationship got more serious, perhaps to accommodate Earhardt and her family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmZmjwK2x2GacmqqYlr%2BlwIysnJqmXZ2ur7rIrbCsZaKqurC%2BxJ1koKGiobOztcSnm2aZnpl6uLTArapmrJiatrN5wKCcZpyZm7OmvsSnmp5n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-ainsley-earhardt-sean-hannitys-rumored-girlfriend-and-whats-their-age-difference.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-ainsley-earhardt-sean-hannitys-rumored-girlfriend-and-whats-their-age-difference.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-ainsley-earhardt-sean-hannitys-rumored-girlfriend-and-whats-their-age-difference.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-ainsley-earhardt-sean-hannitys-rumored-girlfriend-and-whats-their-age-difference.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-ainsley-earhardt-sean-hannitys-rumored-girlfriend-and-whats-their-age-difference.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-ainsley-earhardt-sean-hannitys-rumored-girlfriend-and-whats-their-age-difference.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-delete-brainly-account.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-delete-brainly-account.html>How to delete brainly account</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./amd-radeon-software-crimson-relive-edition-1772.html>Improved WattMan, Shader Cache, and Frame Rate Target Control</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./amd-radeon-software-crimson-relive-edition-1772.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
