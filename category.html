If you look through the recipe index, you‚Äôll find one with strawberries, one with plums, one with a drizzle of mint pesto, and even cute little Caprese skewers with peaches! What you won‚Äôt find, though, is this: a classic Caprese salad with soft, creamy fresh mozzarella, juicy seasonal tomatoes, and a generous amount of basil leaves.&nbsp;It‚Äôs a salad that‚Äôs been near and dear to my heart ever since we visited the island of Capri, years ago, just after Jack proposed. It was a magical trip where we ate Caprese salads‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If your fridge is stuffed with zucchini but it‚Äôs too hot to make zucchini bread, crispy baked summer squash, or stuffed zucchini boats, what should you cook? Grilled zucchini, of course! A lot of the time, I grill zucchini along with a mix of other rainbow veggies, but lately, we‚Äôve had so much of it on hand that I‚Äôve been grilling it up on its own. Luckily for us, it‚Äôs a delicious summer side dish. While a lot of grilled zucchini recipes call for slicing the squash into thin slabs, I like to cut it into wedges. This way, the‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If I had to choose one ingredient that best represents summer, it would have to be the tomato! Everyone loves perfect bright, juicy summer tomatoes, and in my opinion, there‚Äôs no better way to celebrate them than with panzanella! This recipe has been a fan favorite (and one of our favorites) for awhile, so I thought I‚Äôd share it again now that all of these ingredients are in peak season. If you look closely, you‚Äôll see that there are more than just tomatoes in this panzanella. I call this one my ‚Äúeverything summer‚Äù panzanella because I took the liberty of‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Zucchini season is upon us! For me, this time of year is always a race to enjoy summer squash in as many ways as possible. I bake it into cake, blend it into soup, toss it into pasta, layer it into lasagna, and eat it right off the grill. This year, I‚Äôm adding a new recipe to my usual rotation: stuffed zucchini! I first made these a few weeks ago for my family and even my little 2-year old nephew, who is going through a no-zucchini phase, gobbled his up. These easy stuffed zucchini boats are a simple, fresh, and‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I moved to Austin, I discovered how fantastic fresh salsa could be. Whether made with tomatoes, tomatillos, chiles, or fruit, fresh salsas were always tangier, juicier, and more flavorful than their jarred counterparts. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt long before I started making my own at home, and this easy pineapple salsa recipe is one of my favorites. With just 7 ingredients, it couldn‚Äôt be simpler to make. Delectably sweet, spicy & juicy, it‚Äôs the perfect topping for grilled veggies (or grilled meats, if you‚Äôre not vegetarian) and all sorts of Mexican-inspired dishes. I hope you love it as much‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It finally feels like summer around here, and for me there‚Äôs nothing more summery than corn on the cob! When I was a little kid, I remember my mom covering the stoop on the back patio&nbsp;with ripped-open paper bags, and&nbsp;my sister and I would spend hours removing the husks. I love sweet corn so many ways ‚Äì I top it onto pizza, mix it into cornbread and cornbread stuffing, stuff it into tacos, blend it into hummus, add it to soups, chowder, and chili, or top it onto salad. You get the picture: I‚Äôm a corn addict! But my favorite‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>After you try these rainbow fajita veggies, you‚Äôll never need to visit Chipotle again. These guys are super fresh and colorful, tangy, smoky, and perfectly charred. They‚Äôd be a great addition to a burrito or bowl, but for my money, they make a great main dish too. Served alongside tortillas and fresh fixings like guac and salsa, this veggie fajita recipe is a delicious quick and easy dinner. These fajita veggies would make a great weeknight dinner, but they‚Äôre perfect for parties, too! Not only can you make them in under 30 minutes, but they‚Äôre also ideal for serving a‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you‚Äôve been reading the blog for a while, you know that I‚Äôm a huge fan of pickled onions. They‚Äôre tangy, they‚Äôre sweet, they‚Äôre salty ‚Äì really, they‚Äôre just darn good. For the longest time, they‚Äôve been my favorite way to add a bright pop of color and flavor to salads, tacos, sandwiches, and more. But lately, pickled onions have been playing second fiddle to a new quick-pickle favorite: pickled jalape√±os! These guys are the perfect blend of spicy, salty, and sweet. And if you‚Äôre not a fan of spicy foods, they‚Äôre still worth a try. The longer you leave‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This strawberry salad recipe comes from our first cookbook, and it‚Äôs gotten rave reviews time and time again. Like so many spring and summer salads, it‚Äôs a perfect example of how fresh, in-season ingredients can combine to make a delicious dish in no time. This strawberry salad uses under 10 ingredients, but it still has an incredible mix of textures and flavors. The peak-season berries are sweet and juicy, and a handful of soft summer basil adds a surprising fresh accent. Toss in a little cheese and diced avocado for richness, pecans for crunch, and a drizzle of tangy balsamic,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This flatbread pizza recipe is what I make on nights when I‚Äôm in the mood for pizza, but I‚Äôm&nbsp;not&nbsp;in the mood for making pizza dough. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love a good homemade pizza crust, but sometimes, I want to whip up a quick and easy vegetable-tastic topping, pile it on a crust, pop it in the oven, and eat without waiting for the dough to rise. I‚Äôm guessing you feel that way sometimes, too. üôÇ I based this flatbread pizza recipe on the infamous spinach artichoke dip. It embodies everything you love about the dip (creamy! delicious!), but‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Jack and I ate tamago kake gohan (or tamago gohan, for short) over and over again during our trips to Japan. Its name translates to ‚Äúegg rice,‚Äù and that‚Äôs basically what it is ‚Äì a raw egg mixed into piping hot rice. Don‚Äôt be scared ‚Äì the hot rice cooks the egg as you stir it in. The result is Japanese comfort food at its best ‚Äì the most creamy, delicious bowl of rice you‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs almost like risotto, but without so much stirring! It‚Äôs traditional to top tamago kake gohan with furikake and Japanese pickles‚Ä¶ but of‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJno5qutLvNmqNoqJGcsnCCjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcategory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcategory.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcategory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcategory.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcategory.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcategory.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kelly-price-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kelly-price-net-worth-2024.html>Kelly Price Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./all-you-need-to-know-about-dmxs-mother-arnett-simmons.html>All You Need To Know About DMXs Mother, Arnett Simmons</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./all-you-need-to-know-about-dmxs-mother-arnett-simmons.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
