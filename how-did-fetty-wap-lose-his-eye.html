After having released some of the most iconic singles from the last few years, including his commercial debut singles “Trap Queen” and “My Way,” the trapper’s fame continued to skyrocket until, well, it no longer did. In fact, just two months ago, the rapper was forced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to limit his talents to the cold walls of federal prison</a> for six years, for trafficking narcotics across the country.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Despite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this stain in his long record</a>, the rapper was still known for his unique voice and mixture of R&B and hip hop, and the hegemony of genres in his discography, comprised of two albums and several mixtapes. Aside from his music, one of his most prominent features actually lies on his face, immediately evoking questions in everyone who looks at him. In fact, one can humorously say that there is something clearly missing. So, let’s answer the decade-old question: how did Fetty Wap lose his eye?</p><h2 id=h-how-did-fetty-wap-lose-his-eye data-injectable=false><strong>How did Fetty Wap lose his eye</strong>?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>Simply put, Fetty Wap lost his eye after developing a condition when he was just a baby. For a long while, the New Jersey rapper didn’t discuss his eye condition — that is, until 2015 when he finally opened up about it in an interview with DJ Self on Shade 45. It was during this interview that Fetty Wap revealed his eye had developed a condition called Congenital Glaucoma, putting an end to all the rumors surrounding the loss of his eye, some of which even suggested he was shot in the eyeball.</p><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>“When I was little, I had an accident that led to congenital glaucoma in both of my eyes,” he said. For anyone unfamiliar with this condition, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WebMD</a>, this incredibly rare disease is an extremely serious eye condition that affects infants, potentially leading to blindness. In a normal and healthy eye, fluid circulates naturally; however, with congenital glaucoma, this fluid doesn’t drain properly, causing a build-up and an increase in eye pressure. Once the glaucoma is discovered, it’s usually already too late, but Fetty Wap went on to admit that he was particularly lucky.</p><p>“The doctor saved one, I was blessed to still have my vision. That’s it. That’s the story.”</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>The 31-year-old also has no qualms when it comes to talking candidly about his appearance. In the same 2015 interview, he proudly confessed, “I’m probably one of the first rappers to come on the scene with one eye and be comfortable with it.” He also addresses the stigma surrounding his appearance, which often elicits a negative response. “A lot of people are judgmental, but it’s all about how you present yourself to others.”</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>The “Trap Queen” singer had also experimented with a prosthetic eye during his teenage years but has since grown comfortable with his eye ⏤ or lack thereof ⏤ openly embracing his disability as the years go by.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMnaCdZZaawbXFjLCYqWWcpMCmeceiqmadqZp8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-fetty-wap-lose-his-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-did-fetty-wap-lose-his-eye.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-fetty-wap-lose-his-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-did-fetty-wap-lose-his-eye.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-fetty-wap-lose-his-eye.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-fetty-wap-lose-his-eye.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amd-radeon-software-crimson-relive-edition-1772.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amd-radeon-software-crimson-relive-edition-1772.html>Improved WattMan, Shader Cache, and Frame Rate Target Control</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ana-sobonja-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-168569-html.html>Ana Sobonja Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ana-sobonja-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-168569-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
