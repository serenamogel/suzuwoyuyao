From there, his fate as a famous kid began as he was taken to Munich for filming.</p><p class=Fg>“It was sort of like being an exchange student for five months,” Ostrum continued.</p><p class=Fg>Ostrum revealed that his stay in Germany was exciting and he enjoyed every bit, ranging from sightseeing to working on the set of “Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory” alongside other cast members.</p><p class=gi data-testid=image-source>Peter Ostrum and his fellow 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' castmates | Photo: GettyImages</p><p class=Fg>Despite his sterling performance in the movie, he wasn’t so fascinated by the world of “lights” and “action.” He returned home to his parents, and after watching a veterinary doctor treat his father’s horse, the former child star knew what he wanted.</p><p class=Fg>"I can remember the veterinarian coming out and taking care of the horses, and it made a huge impression on me.”</p><p class=Fg>Young Ostrum decided to pursue a career in veterinary medicine, worked as a groom in several stables including the "Delaware Equine Center" in Pennsylvania.

If I didn't pursue that, I'd always kick myself.”</p><p class=Fg>As it is, Peter Ostrum went from being “Charlie with the Golden Ticket” to Dr. Peter Ostrum after earning his DVM degree in 1984 from Cornell University of Veterinary Medicine.</p><p class=Fg>Although his line of work is disparate from acting, Dr. Ostrum isn’t entirely shutting down on Hollywood.
