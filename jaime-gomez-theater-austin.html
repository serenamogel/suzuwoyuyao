The show shines a focus on <a href=#><strong>Jaime Gomez</strong></a>, the man behind <strong>Buddhafield</strong>, who has been active in his role since the 1980s.</p><p>Given the circumstances of his past, it’s no surprise that many are curious to know more about him and his theater and wonder how it ended in South Austin from Hollywood. Well, here is everything we have discovered.</p><h2>Jaime Gomez and a Follower of the Buddhafield Cult Built the One World Theater Together in South Austin, Texas, in 1993!</h2><p><strong>Jaime Gomez </strong>and his Buddhafield cult <a href=# rel=noopener>devotee</a> built One World Theater in South Austin, Texas, in 1993 (albeit the venue’s website makes no mention of the group’s affiliation). It all began in 1992, when a group of different people gathered around Barton Springs their hands clasped and legs swinging in sync.</p><p>They made an appealing crowd, with their long hair and tanned, slim frames, but all eyes were on the man heading the assemblage. He went by several names—<strong>Andreas</strong>, <strong>Michel</strong>, or just <strong>The Teacher</strong>—in his tight-fitting Speedo, black eyeliner, and steely gaze. At his command, they all jumped into the chilly water with a splash.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/08/jaime-gomez-theater-south-austin.jpg alt="One World Theater was constructed in South Austin by Jaime Gomez and a follower of the Buddhafield cult. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>One World Theater was constructed in South Austin by Jaime Gomez and a follower of the Buddhafield cult.<br>Image Source: CNN</strong></p><p>The crowd’s show was uncomfortable for bystanders. But it was only a short view into the Buddhafield, a spiritual sect that had moved to South Austin from Hollywood. It was founded in the 1980s by Michel and offered its hundred members redemption through exercises such as “cleansing” therapy sessions and meditation. Michel went on to say even more.</p><p>The crowd’s show was uncomfortable for bystanders. But it was only a short view into the Buddhafield, a spiritual sect that had moved to South Austin from Hollywood. It was founded in the 1980s by Michel and offered its hundred members redemption through exercises such as “cleansing” therapy sessions and meditation. Furthermore, Michel claimed to have a direct relationship with God, which he referred to as The Knowing.</p><p>But not everything was as it seemed. As time passed, male members realized that Michel’s hypnotic cleansing sessions were essentially fronts for sexual exploitation. The Teacher’s deception deepened as fleeing members were informed they would perish if they did not receive his paternal protection. In the 2016 documentary Holy Hell about the Buddhafield, an ex-follower <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed</a>,</p><p><strong>It got to the point where I didn’t care. I might be dead in a year, but it’s better than being here for another second.</strong></p><p>With Jaime Gomez’s theater imploding, Michel escaped to Hawaii in 2007 with a few of his most devoted followers. The guru now goes by the name<strong> Reyji</strong> (god-king) and teaches yoga near Lanikai Beach. While he has disbanded the Buddhafield and no longer resides in Austin, he has left an indelible mark still remains!</p><h2>Jaime Gomez’s Forced Use of Plastic Surgery Procedures on His Followers Was Highlighted in How to Become a Cult Leader!</h2><p>Have you ever heard of <strong>Jaime Gomez</strong> or the <strong>Buddhafield</strong> cult? The third episode of Netflix’s new true crime series How To Become A Cult Leader will undoubtedly leave you scarred. While the brutal cult leader did not execute his followers, he did leave them with lifelong scars.</p><p>After failing to make it in Hollywood, Gomez was inspired to form his cult, and many of his practices mirrored the exclusivity of the film industry. When it came to bringing in new followers, the cult leader was fussy, and he frequently forced them to accommodate his whims, ensuring that he was enjoying a high-class existence.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/08/jaime-gomez-cult.jpg alt="Jaime Gomez forced his devotee to have plastic surgery. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Jaime Gomez forced his devotee to have plastic surgery.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Image Source: CNN</strong></p><p>Taking things a step further, he forced cult members to undergo plastic surgery in order to ensure that they were all visually beautiful. He&nbsp;first preyed on his fans’ anxieties and encouraged them to seek plastic surgery for their own good. However, he ultimately began making them test new operations that he was interested in trying on his own body to see how they looked. According to one former <a href=# rel=noopener>victim</a>,</p><p><strong>The boys had to shave their chest. He [Gomez] didn’t like hair on the boy’s chest.” And another echoed, “If you didn’t like what you were wearing, either change it or face public ridicule.</strong></p><p>When Gomez began increasing his amount of <strong>Botox</strong> and <strong>silicone implants</strong>, he expected his followers to do the same. According to one interviewee, “People got chin implants, cheek implants, stuff you put in your lips.” Another stressed, “He would have people try out certain things to see what the procedure was and what it would look like after it was done. I did see a lot of beautiful people go through these procedures.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKKRnrqmecaopJ6yXam1pq3TnqlmmaWowaq6jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjaime-gomez-theater-austin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjaime-gomez-theater-austin.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjaime-gomez-theater-austin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjaime-gomez-theater-austin.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjaime-gomez-theater-austin.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjaime-gomez-theater-austin.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./patrice-leconte.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./patrice-leconte.html>Patrice Leconte movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-selena-samuela-pregnant-in-2022-family-with-husband-matt-virtue-as-recent-pictures-can-confuse-many-308274-html.html>Is Selena Samuela Pregnant In 2022?
