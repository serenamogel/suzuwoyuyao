His birth name was Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At an early age, young Clay showed that he wasn’t afraid of any bout—inside or outside of the ring. Growing up in the segregated South, he experienced racial prejudice and discrimination firsthand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the age of 12, Clay discovered his talent for boxing through an odd twist of fate. After his bike was stolen, Clay told police officer Joe Martin that he wanted to beat up the thief. “Well, you better learn how to fight before you start challenging people,” Martin reportedly told him at the time. In addition to being a police officer, Martin also trained young boxers at a local gym.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Clay started working with Martin to learn how to spar and soon began his boxing career. In his first amateur bout in 1954, he won the fight by split decision. Clay went on to win the 1956 Golden Gloves tournament for novices in the light heavyweight class. Three years later, he won the National Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions, as well as the Amateur Athletic Union’s national title for the light heavyweight division.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Clay attended mostly Black public schools, including Central High School in Louisville from 1956 to 1960. Clay <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://explorekyhistory.ky.gov/items/show/890 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="often daydreamed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">often daydreamed</a> in class and shadowboxed in the halls—he was training for the 1960 Olympics at the time—and his grades were so bad that some of his teachers wanted to hold him back from graduation. However, the school’s principal Atwood Wilson could see Clay’s potential and opposed this, sarcastically asking the staff, “Do you think I’m going to be the principal of a school that Cassius Clay didn’t finish?”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Muhammad Ali - Mini Biography" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/7321d6e9-4c7f-41d2-9337-d414cf180d28/thumb_640x360_00002_1673369422_27505.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Olympic Gold" data-anchor-id=olympic-gold class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Olympic Gold</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1960, Clay won a spot on the U.S. Olympic boxing team and traveled to Rome to compete. At 6 feet, 3 inches tall, Clay was an imposing figure in the ring, but he also became known for his lightning speed and fancy footwork. After winning his first three bouts, Clay defeated Zbigniew Pietrzkowski of Poland to win the light heavyweight Olympic gold medal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his Olympic victory, Clay was heralded as an American hero. He soon turned professional with the backing of the Louisville Sponsoring Group and continued overwhelming all opponents in the ring.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 title="Relationship With Malcolm X and Conversion to Islam" data-anchor-id=relationship-with-malcolm-x-and-conversion-to-islam class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Relationship With Malcolm X and Conversion to Islam</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Clay met charismatic Nation of Islam minister <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/malcolm-x data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Malcolm X" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Malcolm X</a> at a rally in Detroit in June 1962. Floored by Malcolm X’s fearlessness as an orator, the two developed a friendship and Clay became more involved in the Black Muslim group. Malcolm X even assigned an associate to help manage Clay’s day-to-day affairs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1964, Malcolm X brought his family to visit Clay while he trained in Florida for his February 25 title fight against <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/sonny-liston data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonny Liston" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sonny Liston</a>. Clay’s victory over Liston earned him his first world heavyweight boxing championship.

Drafted into the military in April 1967, he refused to serve on the grounds that he was a practicing Muslim minister with religious beliefs that prevented him from fighting. He was arrested for committing a felony and almost immediately stripped of his world title and boxing license.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The U.S. Justice Department pursued a legal case against Ali and denied his claim for conscientious objector status.

He was known for boasting about his skills before a fight and for his colorful descriptions and phrases. In one of his more famously quoted descriptions, Ali told reporters that he could “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” in the boxing ring.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A few of his more well-known bouts include the following:</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Sonny Liston</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After winning gold at the 1960 Olympics, Ali took out British heavyweight champion Henry Cooper in 1963.

Ali recovered quickly, but the judges awarded the decision to Frazier, handing Ali his first professional loss after 31 wins.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After suffering a loss to Ken Norton, Ali beat Frazier in a rematch on January 28, 1974.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1975, Ali and Frazier locked horns again for their grudge match on October 1 in Quezon City, Philippines.

However, Frazier’s trainer threw in the towel after the 14th round, giving the hard-fought victory to Ali.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">George Foreman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Another legendary Ali fight took place on October 30, 1974, against undefeated heavyweight champion <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/george-foreman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Foreman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Foreman</a>. Billed as the “Rumble in the Jungle,” the bout was organized by promoter Don King and held in Kinshasa, Zaire.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For once, Ali was seen as the underdog to the younger, massive Foreman, but he silenced his critics with a masterful performance. He baited Foreman into throwing wild punches with his “rope-a-dope” technique, before stunning his opponent with an eighth-round knockout to reclaim the heavyweight title.</p><h2 data-node-id=46 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Leon Spinks</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After losing his title to Leon Spinks on February 15, 1978, Ali defeated him months later in a rematch on September 15.
