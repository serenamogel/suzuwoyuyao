The music and clothes are old-school, but the show remains a timeless favorite to its fans. So what is the cast up to these days?</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Will Smith</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Will Smith followed The Fresh Prince by ascending to Hollywood royalty. In 1996, the same year the show ended, Smith starred in Independence Day, followed by Men in Black (1997) and Enemy of the State (1998). He continued headlining in a string of Hollywood films with much box office success. But in 2013, he starred with his son, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jaden-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jaden Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jaden Smith</a>, in the sci-fi adventure After Earth — a box office flop that he called “the most painful failure” of his career. He bounced back with the DC Comics film Suicide Squad (2016), as an assassin named Deadshot, before pulling out all the stops as Genie in the live-action adaptation of Aladdin (2019). Smith has been married to actress <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jada-pinkett-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jada Pinkett Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jada Pinkett Smith</a> since 1997, and since then, their coupledom has been the stuff of tabloid fodder, along with their kids, Jaden (b. 1998) and Willow (b. 2000).</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Alfonso Ribeiro (Carlton Banks)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After appearing for six seasons as Will’s preppy and uptight cousin, Carlton, Alfonso Ribeiro starred with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/ll-cool-j data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="LL Cool J" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">LL Cool J</a> in the television show In the House and scored numerous cameo roles on TV and film. But the Bronx-born actor says he was pigeonholed by the show, preventing his acting career from really taking off. In 2014, Ribeiro partnered with Witney Carson to win season 19 of Dancing with the Stars, along the way giving fans a taste of the famous Carlton Dance, which he invented. "The dance is ultimately <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/courteney-cox data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Courteney Cox" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Courteney Cox</a> in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bruce-springsteen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bruce Springsteen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bruce Springsteen</a> video 'Dancing in the Dark.'” he said. Riberio followed that success by replacing Tom Bergeron as host of America's Funniest Home Videos and landing his own Cooking Channel series, Unwrapped 2.0.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">James Avery (Uncle Phil)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Phillips Banks, James Avery played the patriarch of the family, and though his patience was tested each week, he was always a loving dad and uncle. Avery was a successful voice actor for such shows as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (he voiced Shredder) and the animated series Iron Man. He also had a role on That 70s Show. In December 2013, at age 68, Avery died due to complications following heart surgery. Following Avery’s death, Smith shared on social media: “Some of my greatest lessons in Acting, Living and being a respectable human being came through James Avery.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Karyn Parsons (Hilary Banks)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the spoiled, ditzy princess of the Banks family, Hilary (played by Karyn Parsons) didn’t win over as many fans as her castmates. Her screen roles post-FPOBA never got the attention of her work as Smith’s cousin (unless you’re a really, really big fan of The Ladies Man). She went on to found Sweet Blackberry, a non-profit whose mission is to bring little-known stories of African American achievement to children everywhere, before publishing her debut novel, How High the Moon.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Joseph Marcell (Geoffrey Butler)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It's been decades since The Fresh Prince ended, but people around the world still yell “Geoffrey” when they encounter Joseph Marcell, the classically trained actor who played the sardonic butler on the show. Marcell has compiled his share of screen credits since then, including a stint on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, but mainly found success via the stage in productions of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/william-shakespeare data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shakespeare's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Shakespeare's</a> King Lear, The Tempest and Macbeth.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tatyana Ali (Ashley Banks)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The most down-to-earth sibling on the show, Ashley Banks was, for many tween audience members, the cast member they related to the most. Her struggles with becoming a teen was a recurring theme. (Who can forget the episode when she was accused of shoplifting?) After the show ended, Tatyana Ali pursued a recording career, starred in such indie flicks as The Clown at Midnight, oh, and graduated from Harvard. Along with nabbing leading roles in the series Love That Girl! and Second Generation Wayans, the former child star has proven to be fully grown by starting a family of her own.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Janet Hubert and Daphne Maxwell Reid (Aunt Vivian)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Aunt Viv, Janet Hubert rode the success of the show but when she got pregnant, things got real. Real ugly. She claimed the producers forced her out of her role, but rumor has it there was tension between her and Smith. Whatever the case, Hubert left FPOBA but continued to have TV roles on shows such as Gilmore Girls, Friends, The Bernie Mac Show and General Hospital. She was replaced by Daphne Maxwell Reid, a model-turned-actress who has since pursued other creative interests as a photographer, designer and author.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVonaudo516sb7Ip5qeZZ%2BbeqOxy2aYoqpdmK60wIywn56qlWKus7GMrZ%2BesV2jvLg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-where-are-they-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sidharth-bharathan-second-wedding-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sidharth-bharathan-second-wedding-html.html>Actor-director Sidharth Bharathan gets hitched</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./android-422-update-for-htc-one-rollout-begins-we-take-a-look.html>Android 4.2.2 Update Rollout for HTC One Begins</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./android-422-update-for-htc-one-rollout-begins-we-take-a-look.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
