Eventually, he controlled over 80 percent of the cocaine shipped to the United States, earning the nickname “The King of Cocaine.” He amassed an estimated net worth of $30 billion and was named one of the 10 richest people on Earth by Forbes. He earned popularity by sponsoring charity projects and soccer clubs, but later, terror campaigns that resulted in the murder of thousands turned public opinion against him. After surrendering to the Colombian authorities in 1991, Escobar escaped detainment in 1992 and was a fugitive until his dramatic death in December 1993.</p><h2 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria<br>BORN: December 1, 1949<br>DIED: December 2, 1993<br>BIRTHPLACE: Rionegro, Antioquia, Colombia<br>SPOUSE: Maria Victoria Henao (1976-1993)<br>CHILDREN: Juan Pablo and Manuela<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius</p><h2 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was born on December 1, 1949, in the Colombian city of Rionegro, Antioquia. His family later moved to the suburb of Envigado. He was the third of seven children born in poverty to a schoolteacher mother and a peasant farmer father. From an early age, Escobar packed a unique ambition to raise himself up from his humble beginnings and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://stmuscholars.org/pablo-escobar-robin-hood-or-drug-dealer/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=dreamed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">dreamed</a> of becoming the president of Colombia one day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Escobar reportedly began his life of crime early, stealing tombstones and selling phony diplomas. It wasn’t long before he started stealing cars, then moving into the smuggling business. Escobar’s early prominence came <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-pablo-escobar-1465149.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="during the “Marlboro Wars,”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">during the “Marlboro Wars,”</a> in which he played a high-profile role in the control of Colombia’s smuggled cigarette market. This episode proved to be a valuable training ground for the future narcotics kingpin.<br></p><h2 title="Establishing the Medellín Cartel" data-anchor-id=establishing-the-medelln-cartel class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Establishing the Medellín Cartel</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It wasn’t by chance that Colombia came to dominate the cocaine trade. Beginning in the early 1970s, the country became a prime smuggling ground for marijuana. But as the cocaine market flourished, Colombia’s geographical location proved to be its biggest asset. Situated at the northern tip of South America between the thriving coca cultivation epicenters of Peru and Bolivia, the country came to dominate the global cocaine trade with the United States, the biggest market for the drug and just a short trip to the north.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Escobar, who had already been involved in organized crime for a decade at this point, moved quickly to grab control of the cocaine trade. In 1975, the drug trafficker Fabio Restrepo from the city of Medellín, Colombia, was murdered. It was widely believed his death came at the orders of Escobar, who immediately seized power and expanded Restrepo’s operation into something the world had never seen. Under Escobar’s leadership, large amounts of coca paste were purchased in Bolivia and Peru then processed and transported to America. Escobar worked with a small group to form the infamous Medellín cartel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also around this time, Escobar started a family with his marriage to Maria Victoria Henao, who was 11 years his junior and still a teenager at the time of their 1976 wedding. They went on to have two children.</p><h2 title="Rapid Rise in Power " data-anchor-id=rapid-rise-in-power class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Rapid Rise in Power</h2><img alt="a 1989 tv wanted ad, in spanish, for cartel leaders pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez, headshots of both men appear on screen in addition to the text" title="A 1989 TV wanted ad for cartel leaders Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez" width=2048 height=1453 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/an-image-taken-06-september-1989-from-colombian-television-news-photo-1681765116.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>A wanted notice for Pablo Escobar and fellow Medellín cartel leader José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha on Colombian television.</p><p><h2 class="css-hsosn9 erccrpd0">Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$16 at Amazon for Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241365+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-07-28T16:03:03.241381+00:00"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$16 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-vars-ga-product-brand="Grove Press" data-vars-ga-product-id=fced65ee-f13a-4f9d-888e-fc2c301ee274 data-vars-ga-product-price=$15.93 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=04a4168b-e36c-48c4-ae4a-199c51d0d296 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Grove Press" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | On Sale" data-vars-ga-sku=0802127738 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link e1c4wdig0 e14dd8uh0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw" title="Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1682719232-81EZ2YHb1mL.jpg width=1200 height=1811 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-hsosn9 erccrpd0">Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw</h2></p><p>Now 11% Off</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Escobar’s rapid rise brought him to the attention of the Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS), who arrested him in May 1976 upon his return from a drug trafficking trip in Ecuador. Authorities found 39 kilograms of cocaine hidden in the spare tire of his truck. Escobar escaped the charges by bribing a judge, and the two DAS agents responsible for his arrest were killed the next year, according to Mark Bowden book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Killing Pablo" data-vars-ga-product-id=da68d2e2-0e03-45bc-ac94-ac8c54c1fcf9 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802127738 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Grove Press" data-vars-ga-product-price=$15.93 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=04a4168b-e36c-48c4-ae4a-199c51d0d296 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Grove Press" class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Killing Pablo</a>.

After Escobar’s death, it was turned into a theme park.

That included establishing a shipment base <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53070547 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="on a private island" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">on a private island</a> in the Bahamas with the help of cartel cofounder Carlos Lehder. By the mid-1980s, Escobar had an estimated net worth of $30 billion and was named one of the 10 richest people on Earth by Forbes. Cash was so prevalent that Escobar purchased a Learjet for the sole purpose of flying his money. At the time, Escobar controlled more than 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States; more than 15 tons were reportedly smuggled each day, netting the Medellín cartel as much as $420 million a week.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Escobar’s fortune and fame grew, he dreamed to be seen as a leader. In some ways, he positioned himself as a Robin Hood–like figure, a description was echoed by many locals, by spending money to expand social programs for the poor. He spent millions to develop Medellín’s poor neighborhoods, where its residents felt he helped them far more than the government ever had. He built roads, electric lines, soccer fields, roller-skating rinks, and more, and paid the workers in his cocaine labs enough money that they could afford houses and cars, according to Bowden.</p><h2 title="Escobar’s Short-Lived Stint in Politics" data-anchor-id=escobars-short-lived-stint-in-politics class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Escobar’s Short-Lived Stint in Politics</h2><img alt="a city street with a poster showing a presidential election advertisement and four photos of pablo escobar" title="Election posters for Pablo Escobar" width=2400 height=1503 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/posters-with-the-portrait-of-late-leader-of-colombian-drug-news-photo-1681421403.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Presidential election posters for Pablo Escobar grace a street in Botata, Colombia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still harboring his youthful ambition to become the nation’s president, Escobar entered politics and supported the formation of the Liberal Party of Colombia. In 1982, he was elected as an alternate member of Colombia’s Congress, but Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara-Bonilla investigated him and highlighted the illegal means by which he had obtained his wealth, forcing Escobar to resign two years after his election.

When he realized that he had no shot of becoming Colombia’s president, and with the United States pushing for his capture and extradition, Escobar unleashed his fury on his enemies in the hopes of influencing Colombian politics. His goal was a no-extradition clause and amnesty for drug barons in exchange for giving up the trade.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Escobar’s terror campaign claimed the lives of three Colombian presidential candidates, an attorney general, scores of judges, and more than 1,000 police officers. In addition, Escobar was implicated as the mastermind behind the bombing of a Colombian jetliner. In November 1989, Escobar <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-sicarios-tale-part-1-escobars-top-hitman-tells-how-i-blew-up-more-than-100-people data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="arranged for a bomb" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">arranged for a bomb</a> to be planted on Avianca Flight 203, a domestic passenger flight, as part of an assassination attempt against one of his political enemies, presidential candidate César Gaviria Trujillo. He missed the flight and avoided injury, but the bomb detonated and killed all 107 people on board.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nine days after the airplane bombing, more than 50 people were killed and more than 2,200 were injured when <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/08/world/colombia-cartels-tied-to-bombing.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a truck bomb detonated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a truck bomb detonated</a> outside a DAS building in Bogotá, Colombia.

In June 1991, Escobar negotiated a surrendered to Gaviria’s government in exchange for a reduced sentence and preferential treatment during his captivity. A law at the time prevented his extradition to the United States.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Escobar built his own luxury prison <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.loveproperty.com/gallerylist/162670/pablo-escobar-the-extravagant-homes-of-the-infamous-billionaire-drug-lord data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="called La Catedral," class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">called La Catedral,</a> which was guarded by men he handpicked from among his employees.

A manhunt for the drug lord, with help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, was launched that would last 16 months. During that time, the monopoly of the Medellín cartel, which had begun to crumble during Escobar’s imprisonment as police raided offices and killed its leaders, rapidly deteriorated.</p><h2 title=Death data-anchor-id=death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Escobar’s family unsuccessfully sought asylum in Germany and eventually found refuge in a Bogotá hotel. Escobar was not so lucky: Colombian law enforcement finally caught up to the fugitive Escobar on December 2, 1993, in a middle-class neighborhood in Medellín. A firefight ensued, and as Escobar tried to escape across a series of rooftops, he and his bodyguard were shot and killed.
