<time>08 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>She originally came to public recognition when she took part in the Lifetime reality series Dance Moms from 2011 to 2016.</strong></p><p>After Sia placed in many music videos, beginning with “Chandelier” and “Elastic Heart,” which have gathered more than 5 billion views on YouTube, she started to get more notice.</p><p>Ziegler has made appearances in films, TV shows, live performances, advertisements, and magazine covers. From 2015 to 2017, she was consistently included on Time magazine’s list of the “30 Most Influential Teens.”</p><p>Ziegler performed dancing tours with her sister Mackenzie and accompanied Sia on her 2016 and 2017 North American and Australian tours. In 2016, she also participated in So You Think You Can Dance: The Next Generation as a judge.</p><h2>Is Maddie Ziegler a Gay Person?</h2><p>Maddie Ziegler isn’t homosexual. Ziegler has been seeing up-and-coming musician Eddie Benjamin since March 2020, and her romantic life is also flourishing.</p><p>One of the many aspects of Ziegler’s life that has prospered recently is her career.</p><p>The Australian singer-songwriter and music producer got his start when he was just 16 years old and first gained notoriety, exactly like his girlfriend.</p><p>Because Benjamin is still somewhat new to the music industry, fans could find him to be a little enigmatic. But there is one certain thing: the two rising stars are madly in love.</p><p>Benjamin was born and raised in Bondi Beach, Australia. He claimed in an interview with Euphoria Magazine in 2021 that he was nurtured in a musical environment because his father was a drummer.</p><p>By the time he was a teenager, he had mastered the piano, guitar, and bass, among other instruments.</p><h2>Details of Maddie Ziegler’s partners</h2><p>When he began producing music for well-known artists like Meghan Trainor, Ryan Tedder, Labrinth, and Earth, Wind & Fire at age 16, Benjamin gained his first taste of fame.</p><p>To launch his music career, Benjamin moved to Los Angeles in 2020, just before the COVID-19 epidemic. Justin Bieber and Sia were among the first celebrities to notice him.</p><p>Bieber originally approached Benjamin after viewing a video of the young artist singing on Instagram, according to Benjamin, who shared this information in an interview with WiLD 94.9.</p><p>Following that, the two grew close, with Bieber serving as Benjamin’s tutor and protector.</p><p>Benjamin was Justin Bieber’s opening act for the first leg of the Justice World Tour until the “Holy” singer had to postpone it in 2022 due to health issues.</p><p>Early Years Kurt Ziegler and Melissa Ziegler-Gisoni, who own a mortgage company, welcomed their daughter Maddie Ziegler into the world in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her ancestry is Polish, German, and Italian.</p><p>Her parents divorced when she was six years old, and her mother later married Greg Gisoni. Ballet classes for Ziegler began when she was two years old.</p><p>She started training with the Abby Lee Dance Company when she was four years old, where she learned tap, ballet, lyrical, modern, acro, jazz, and aerial dance.</p><p>Ziegler has a younger sister, Mackenzie, who is a singer and dancer who co-starred with her on Dance Moms, two older half-brothers from her father’s previous marriage, two older step-siblings from her stepfather, Greg Gisoni, a vice president at Westinghouse Electric Company, and two younger half-siblings.</p><p>Ziegler attended Sloan Elementary School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, not far from Pittsburgh, before leaving in 2013 to explore homeschooling.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Giacomo Raspadori, Ivan Rakitic, and Ysabelle Wallace."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":64}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/giacomo-raspadori/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/ivan-rakitic/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/ysabelle-wallace/"}{"1":64}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Giacomo Raspadori</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ivan Rakitic</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ysabelle Wallace</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Rocky Astro Girlfriend | Is He Dating Park Bo Yeon | Rumors Explained</a></h3>Rocky is a famous South Korean dancer, rapper, singer, actor, and composer.
