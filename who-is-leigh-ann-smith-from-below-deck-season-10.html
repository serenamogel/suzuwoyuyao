<time>30 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Season 10 of Below Deck is set to premiere on Bravo this week with a brand new episode featuring the introduction of a new stew and the return of Captain Lee Rosbach. In the previous episode, Commander Sandy Yawn fired cook Alissa Humber.</strong></p><p>Leigh-Ann Smith, her substitute, will join the boat before Captain Lee arrives in the forthcoming show. Deckhand Ben Willoughby and the visitor have dated in the past, so Leigh will recognize a familiar figure on the yacht. According to the show’s mid-season teaser, the two will share some private moments in the upcoming episodes.</p><h2>Leigh-Ann Smith was born in Cape Town</h2><p>Although Bravo has yet to release Leigh-Ann Smith’s formal bio, her Instagram handle reveals enough about her personality. Leigh is an adventure seeker who was born in Cape Town, South Africa. She describes herself as a “Motorsport Fanatic, Ice-Cream Addict, and Career Visionary” on her Instagram profile.</p><p>The majority of her web pictures show her competing in dirt bike events, as well as off-road motorbike and automobile rallies. She has worked in the yachting industry for over five years and is well-versed in it. She has worked on several superyachts, including “Q,” and was previously the head cook on another vessel.</p><p>Leigh is devoted to her family, which includes her father and two brothers. Her mother died in 2018. Her father, Captain Colin Smith, is a race car driver. Leigh two brothers are Wayne Smith (Africa Cinema Academy Award nominee) and Guy Smith. Leigh will make her television debut this week on Season 10 of Below Deck. She will work as a chef assistant to head chef Fraser Olender.</p><h2>Below Deck season ten episode 14 date, location, and plot</h2><p>The 14th episode of Below Deck season ten will air on Bravo on Monday, February 27, 2023, at 8 p.m. ET. A new character, Leigh-Ann Smith, will appear in the upcoming show. She has taken the place of Alissa Humber, who was fired by Commander Sandy in episode 13. The skipper teased the crew by saying that the yacht’s original commander, Lee Rosbach, is about to return.</p><p>For those who are uninformed, Captain Lee took a mid-season hiatus due to health issues. Sandy temporarily filled in for Lee, but she’ll be leaving in the next episode. The synopsis for Below Deck season 10 episode 14, “Big Deck Energy,” is as follows:</p><p><strong>“Cook Rachel prepares a memorable meal; the crew throws a 1980s party for the beauty queen guests; visitor LaQuish continues to annoy the interior team; Tony has a disagreement with Katie; and Ross is forced to confess his boat obsession.”</strong></p><p>The new show will include both new and returning characters, as well as the original celebrity action. A party of guests aboard the boat in the prior show, and one of the guests, LaQuisha, irritated the staff members. She will be seen continuing her annoying behavior in the upcoming episode. Meanwhile, Below Deck supporters are looking forward to Captain Lee’s arrival because they dislike Sandy. While she was captain, two employees, Alissa Humber and Camille Lamb were fired.</p><p>Among the new hires is Commander Lee, cook Rachel Hargrove, and head simmers Fraser Olender. They are also made up of three deckhands: Luis Antonio “Tony” Duarte, Katie Glaser, and Ben Willoughby, as well as stew Hayley De Sola Pinto, stew Leigh-Ann Smith, deck stew Tyler Walker, bosun Ross McHarg, and stew Hayley De Sola Pinto.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Below Deck</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>“Ready to Love” Season 6 Reunion Is Set To Be Released On OWN TV</a></h3>A new, explosive episode of Ready to Love will air when it returns.
