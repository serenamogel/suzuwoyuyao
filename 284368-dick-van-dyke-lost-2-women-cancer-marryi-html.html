They both died of cancer, and he lied to Triola when she asked if she would beat her illness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4343cc58931b36fb2681ff33f165c44c.jpg><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Dick Van Dyke on November 29, 2018 in Los Angeles, California [left].

In 1945, she broke up with her high school boyfriend – a member of the football and wrestling teams – to be with the aspiring actor.</p><p class=Wg>Three years later, the couple was determined to tie the knot, but they didn't have money. Still, they married on an ABC radio show called "Bride and Groom" in 1948.</p><p class=Wg>Van Dyke and Willett moved to Malibu, and she got pregnant with twins. She lost the babies, and while they were in the hospital, their landlord evicted them for not paying rent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e88a134a2d9ac10ba30fc12c8a449850.jpg><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Dick Van Dyke on July 11, 1955 on "The Morning Show" | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg>The lovebirds kept trying to enlarge their family and welcomed four children. Their finances improved when Van Dyke's acting career skyrocketed in the 1960s. Still, Willett preferred a quiet life and spent most of her time in the family's Arizona ranch.</p><p class=Wg>In 1976, after being together for over three decades, Van Dyke and Willett parted ways. The actor admitted he started an affair with actress Michelle Triola. They officially divorced in 1984.</p><p class=Wg>Willett kept her life away from the spotlight following her divorce, and it is unclear if she ever remarried. She made headlines again in 2008 when she passed away from pancreatic cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4a05320375bd086e263c76457ea80a07.jpg><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Dick Van Dyke with his wife Margie Willett on April 15, 1964 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg><strong class=Ug>VAN DYKE'S LONGTIME PARTNER</strong></p><p class=Wg>Van Dyke and <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/michelle-triola-marvin/>Triola's relationship</a> was much more than an affair, but he was not the only celebrity Triola dated. The "Diagnosis: Murder" actress was in a relationship with actor Lee Marvin for six years.</p><p class=Wg>Triola and Marvin's romance also began as an affair: he was still married to the mother of his four children. They split in 1970, and she received $833 a month from him.</p><h3 class=ah><strong class=Ug>He had never been without a partner looking out for him.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2253c9dbbec0408ed8cb0ec856966df5.jpg><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Michelle Triola and Dick Van Dyke in Los Angeles, California in 2007 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg>They previously agreed she would give up on her career to be his companion and homemaker. In exchange, Marvin would support Triola her whole life. She took him to court when he stopped sending her money in 1971.</p><p class=Wg>Although the judge sided with Marvin, the actor had to pay Triola $104,000 for palimony. The court overturned that decision in 1981, though. Shortly after leaving Marvin, Triola met Van Dyke. Although they never married, they lived together for over 30 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/212613d026f1ad757c6599f176e209ab.jpg><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Dick Van Dyke on October 27, 2017 in Beverly Hills, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg><strong class=Ug>TWO PAINFUL LOSSES</strong></p><p class=Wg>While Van Dyke and Willett had been separated for 24 years, her passing was hard to process.
