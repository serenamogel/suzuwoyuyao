The following decade, Reynolds won the respect of her peers with her title role in the musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown, for which she received an Academy Award nomination. She continued to act and sing for more than 40 more years via film, television and the stage.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Background and Early Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Debbie Reynolds was born Mary Frances Reynolds on April 1, 1932, in El Paso, Texas. Reynolds, who got her start in beauty pageants before being discovered by a Warner Bros. film scout, made her cinematic debut in a modest part in 1948's June Bride, followed by a more noticeable role in musical The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady (1950).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Signing with MGM later that year, she showcased her flair for impersonation in Three Little Words, in which she portrayed 1920s vocalist Helen Kane.

(1952), Give a Girl a Break (1953) and Hit the Deck (1955). The actress's most famed turn was in Singin' in the Rain (1952). At 19 years old, she starred opposite Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, shining in numbers such as "Good Morning" and "All I Do Is Dream of You." Parts in other lighthearted projects followed, including The Affairs of Dobie Gillis (1953), Athena (1954) and The Catered Affair (1956).</p><img alt="Gene Kelly: Debbie Reynolds was 18 when she starred as Gene Kelly's love interest in Singin' in the Rain.

(1971), Reynolds did not act in films for an extended period of time, outside of voice-over work as the title character in the 1973 animated feature Charlotte's Web. Instead, she turned toward stage work, spending the next few years performing in Las Vegas nightclubs and on Broadway, where she received a Tony Award nomination for the 1973 revival of Irene.
