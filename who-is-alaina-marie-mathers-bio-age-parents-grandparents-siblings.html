Nelson-Mathers acting as guardian.&nbsp;From then on, the twins formed a special bond with Eminem.&nbsp;Later, Marshall Bruce Mathers III – Eminem fell in love with Kimberly.</span></span></p><p><span class=w8qArf><span>Unfortunately, Dawn Scott, out of frustration and drug and alcohol addictions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, couldn’t be saved.&nbsp;As she kept refusing to get the much-needed help to put her life in order.&nbsp;This behavior prompted Eminem and Kim to adopt young Amanda Scott to give her a better life and a sense of belonging to a family.</span></span></p><p><span class=w8qArf><span>Sadly, after years of battling substance abuse, Alaina Marie Mathers’ biological mother was found dead in her room in 2016 from a suspected heroin overdose.</span></span></p><p><span>Notable is the fact that high school sweethearts Kim and Eminem have&nbsp;</span><span class=w8qArf><span>been married twice but also divorced twice</span></span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Their relationship lasted 20 years and then finally ended.&nbsp;The final split came after a dispute between Kim and Nathan – Eminem’s brother.</span></p><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Through adoption, Alaina Marie Mathers became the grandson of Deborah R. Nelson-Mathers Briggs and Marshall Bruce Mathers II.</span></span></p><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Rapper Eminem’s mother has had her fair share of his tongue on his songs.&nbsp;Her high willingness to deal with her children and some of her earlier attitudes towards his love life and other actions have been castigated by Eminem in some of his songs.</span></span></p><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>However, the real biological grandparents due to the birth of Alaina Marie Mathers are Casimer Sluck and Kathleen Sluck;&nbsp;Kim and Dawn Scott’s parents.</span></span></p><h2><strong><span>siblings</span></strong></h2><p><span>Her adopted siblings include Haile Jade Scott Mathers, a social bee who was born two years later in December 1995.&nbsp;</span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Alaina Marie Mathers</span></span><span>&nbsp;was born when Whitney Scott Mathers was born in April 2002.&nbsp;She was the result of a relationship between Eric Hatter and Kim.</span></p><p><span>Whitney Likes&nbsp;</span><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Alaina Marie Mathers was adopted by Kim and Eminem in 2005 after they got back together after Kim’s stint in rehab.</span></span></p><p><span class="LrzXr kno-fv"><span>Alaina Marie Mathers and her two sisters have matching necklaces that their father made for them.&nbsp;It is estimated to be worth approximately $375,000.&nbsp;</span></span><span>She also has other direct siblings from her mother Dawn Scott namely;&nbsp;However, not much is known about Patrick Scott and Adams Scott, other than that they are not under the care of the Eminem.</span></p><p><span>It is reported that Adams is both a mentally and physically disabled person, possibly due to the fact that his mother used drugs seriously while she was pregnant with him.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMmqOaoZ6Weq6t0aKcZqWRqbWmvtJmmaKnXZa0pnnPmqmepqSoeqi%2BwKebqZmimru1v4ysoJukmaO0tHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-alaina-marie-mathers-bio-age-parents-grandparents-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-alaina-marie-mathers-bio-age-parents-grandparents-siblings.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-alaina-marie-mathers-bio-age-parents-grandparents-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-alaina-marie-mathers-bio-age-parents-grandparents-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-alaina-marie-mathers-bio-age-parents-grandparents-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-alaina-marie-mathers-bio-age-parents-grandparents-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hogwarts-legacy-levioso-wingardium-leviosa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hogwarts-legacy-levioso-wingardium-leviosa.html>Difference Between Levioso And Wingardium Leviosa Explained</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rhona-mitra-net-worth-53849.html>Rhona Mitra Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rhona-mitra-net-worth-53849.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
